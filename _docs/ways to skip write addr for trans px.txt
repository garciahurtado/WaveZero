ways to skip write addr for trans px
------------------------------------


- SM2 keeps initial write addr
	- must not lose track of it until sprite end
	- will increase by +2 everyime it receives trans signal from SM0
	- Would need a way to track non transpx write address increase

- SM2 tracks row write addrs
	- could add a third addr to value_addrs (Same as the second one)
	- Would need a way to track non transpx write address increase

- SM2 doesnt remember anything
	1.
		- when SM0 sees transpx, must send current write addr to SM2
		- THis means SM0 also needs to track write addr (currently doesnt)
	2. 
		- when SM0 sees transpx, SM2 looks up current write address in DMA regs


- In all cases, SM0 must wait for write addr to be updated before processing next pixel
- In all cases, horiz scaling pattern needs to be advanced
